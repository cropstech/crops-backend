Thumbnail handling for visual assets
Version control for assets
Custom metadata schemas per workspace
Asset sharing capabilities
Comments/annotations on assets

To complete the implementation, you'll need to:
Create permission decorators/middleware for checking workspace access
Implement email sending for invitations
Add password validation for protected share links
Create serializers for different content types
Add rate limiting for share link access
Implement caching for frequently accessed shared content
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects?
